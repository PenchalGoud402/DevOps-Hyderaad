this is java file created by penchal..... practicing new thing in git. and practiced  so many git command like git add , git commit 
 git push - u origin master, git pull, git fetch, git diff commitid1 commit2, git log, git show commitid, git status.
   and also cofigire the global varibale like  git config --global user.name "PenchalGoud402@"
                                               git config --global user.email "Penchal.dps@gmail.com"
  and  i can create  multiple branches in git like git branch "branch name" we have two branches which is master and bug1 branch. if we want to push your code to remote
  repositary. you should be in master branch only.
    
  i was push my files local repositary to remote repository by using username and token Creds. if you want to see those token creds you should go to setting, Devloper
  setting and select personal  token access and click Generate token
